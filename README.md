# Furcadia-Dream-Project
A large furcadia dream, Long term project

----

Updates (Master)
--------------

- Cleaned the files in root folder, moved to Patches
- Cleaned out Branches, they were behind in commits and had no new content. Once a branch is created, it is a snapshot of all the folders at the time of it's creation and gets behind in commits.  One had a Pull request, however, the pull request was the same content as what is in the Patches folder.
- Uploaded Thumb1.png, as a rough idea where the different regions might be.
